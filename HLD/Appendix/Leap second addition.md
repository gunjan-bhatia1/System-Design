* There is an e.g. of adding leap second on June 30 due to which multiple system got hang in 2012.
* Due to earth irregular rotation sometime day become shorter or longer and to keep word clock in sync with earth rotation 1 extra second was added.
* Now the systems didn't know what to do at that extra sec. that means instead of going from 12:00:59 -> 12:01:00 it went to 12:00:60
* Let's take the case of traffic light which is designed that as soon as 60 sec will be over light will be changed. But now it has 1 extra sec and system don't have instruction what to do. It crashes.
* To handle this **leap smearing** is done by companies that means instead of adding extra sec it stretches entire day or year to prevent the effect being recognised.
* Similar to instead of adding extra stair we increase the height of each stair.
